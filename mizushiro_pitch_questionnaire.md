# Mizushiro Pitch Questionnaire

---

## Part 1: Executive Summary

**Company Name:** Mizushiro

**The Comparison:** Think of us as "Aave for the other 90%." We are building lending infrastructure for the thousands of tokens that major protocols ignore.

**What We Do:** Mizushiro is an omnichain lending platform that lets users borrow and lend over 300 crypto assets across more than 10 blockchain networks. We serve the $2.9 trillion in crypto value that currently has no access to lending markets.

---

## Part 2: The Problem

**Who We Serve:**
- Holders of small and mid cap tokens who want to earn yield on their assets
- Active traders who need to short, hedge, or arbitrage tokens outside the top 20

**The Core Problem:** Small cap tokens see extreme price swings but have no lending markets. This traps liquidity and prevents essential trading strategies like shorting, hedging, and arbitrage. The result is billions of dollars sitting idle and unused.

**How People Solve This Today:**
- Major protocols like Aave, Euler, Morpho, Radiant, Spark, and Kamino only support blue chip tokens
- For small caps, users have one or two obscure protocols with extreme rates, or nothing at all
- Moving assets between chains requires manual bridging
- The entire process is complex and designed only for advanced DeFi users

**Why Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- Limited asset support, focused only on blue chips
- Harsh liquidations that wipe out 100% of a position instantly, even during brief price dips
- Poor user experience that makes basic tasks like bridging and yield strategies difficult
- No seamless omnichain experience, forcing users to manually bridge between networks
- No integration with real world assets

**The Cost of This Problem:**
- $2.9 trillion in crypto sits idle with no lending access
- $100 billion in DeFi TVL has less than 3% asset utilization
- PYTH, a $1 billion token, had only one lending protocol available
- Borrowers paid 45,000% APY on PYTH because no alternatives existed
- PYTH price doubled from $0.115 to $0.23 and crashed in a single day
- Borrow rates on save.finance spiked from 5.4% to 38,000% in just three days
- 90% of the crypto market cap has zero lending access

---

## Part 3: Our Solution

**What We Built:**
- An omnichain lending protocol
- Support for over 300 assets
- Integration with more than 10 blockchain networks
- One click bridging with no manual steps
- Partial liquidation and automatic rebalancing
- Ready to use yield strategies
- A bridge connecting crypto to real world assets

**What Users Get:**
- One click access to any chain with zero friction
- The ability to lend tokens that previously had no market
- Tools to short, hedge, and arbitrage small cap tokens

- Plug and play strategies for instant yield generation

**Why We Are 10x Better:**

By enabling lending for trending tokens early, Mizushiro captures extreme borrowing demand, organic TVL growth from active traders, and free marketing through viral small cap momentum.

| Capability | Mizushiro | Major Protocols |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Assets | 300+ | 10 to 20 blue chips |
| Chains | 10+ with omnichain support | Single chain or 2 to 3 |
| Liquidation | Partial 50% with auto rebalancing | 100% instant wipeout |
| User Experience | One click, no bridging | Manual and multi step |
| Real World Assets | Integrated | Not available |
| Market Coverage | 90% of market cap | Around 10% |

## Part 5: Our Unique Insight

**What We Understand That Others Miss:**

The hidden 90% of the crypto market is desperate for lending access. When PYTH, a $1 billion token, had only one lending protocol, borrowers paid 45,000% APY. This is not an anomaly. It represents the entire long tail market waiting to be served. Being first to support over 300 assets creates compounding network effects that are hard to replicate.

**Why Now:**
- Omnichain infrastructure has matured, making AggLayer integration possible
- Real world asset tokenization is moving from experiment to reality, representing a $16 trillion market
- DeFi users are frustrated with fragmented and complex experiences
- Blue chip lending has become commoditized, and growth now lives in the long tail

**Our Competitive Moat:**
- First mover advantage on 300+ small cap assets captures liquidity and pricing data
- AggLayer integration by Polygon for seamless cross chain operations
- Partnership with the Polygon ecosystem
- Prom Network partnership for launch and liquidity
- Gateway.fm provides proven enterprise grade backend infrastructure
- Our omnichain one click experience is difficult for competitors to add retroactively

## Part 6: Business Model

**How We Make Money:**
- Interest rate spread on lending and borrowing
- Protocol fees on transactions
- Liquidation fees
- Premium features for yield strategies

**Pricing:**
- Variable interest rates based on pool utilization, following the standard DeFi lending model
- Protocol fee percentage on interest paid, to be determined

**Unit Economics:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost: Low, driven by organic growth through token community virality and a point and reward system
- Customer Lifetime Value: High, as lending protocols have strong retention and depositors compound their returns over years
